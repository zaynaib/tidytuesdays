# Tidy Tuesday

TidyTuesday is a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. 
This project first started with the [R4DS Online Learning Community](
https://www.rfordatasci.com/) . Personally I have been using Python and Javascript for most of my career. I tend to gravity towards the R community because it's a welcoming community for learning. I would like to make my use of R a daily habit for the year 2023 and become better at data visualization!

Happy New Year and if you are reading this I hope you also reach your goals for the year too! :grin:
